## About
Typically websites like these are for blogging. But I'm not a blogger. So instead my website is a collection of guides with minimal explanation that I use as reference for my own benefit.


The reason for the "_minimally explained_" bit is to keep it brief and fast to glance through.

> See the [docs section](/categories/) for a list of contents.

If you've found your way to this website and use the guides for your own setup and find some parts to be either out of date or could use a little more than _minimal explanation_, then feel free to open an issue in github.

### About me

I'm Christopher.

I'm a **Software Engineer** with over a decade of experience. I primarily focus on DevEx and system integrations. This means writing a lot of CLI tools for CI pipelines, frontend programs for self-service portals.

I like to tinker with both backend and frontend technologies and have written my own chat

- <https://chat.christopherbaklid.com>

A task distributor

- <https://github.com/Inveracity/nats-python-example>

A desktop application to increase the volume on videos

And much more.

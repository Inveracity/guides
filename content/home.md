## `readme`

This is a collection of guides with minimal explanation that I use as reference for my own benefit.
The reason for the "_minimally explained_" bit is to keep it brief and fast to glance through. See the [docs section](/categories/) for a list of contents.
Feel free to open an issue on GitHub if you find anything to be wrong or out-of-date.

## `about`

I'm Christopher.

I'm a **Software Engineer** with over a decade of experience. I primarily focus on DevEx and system integrations.
This means writing a lot of CLI tools, self-service UIs and infrastructure-as-code.

## `projects`

I like to tinker with both backend and frontend technologies. Here's a list of personal projects that cover a few:

| Project          | Description   | Source | URL | Technologies |
|:-----------------|:--------------|:-------|:----|:-------------|
| Chat             | Realtime Chat app on gRPC streaming | <https://github.com/Inveracity/svelte-grpc-stream> | <https://chat.christopherbaklid.com> | Svelte, Go, gRPC, PocketBase, NATS, Redis |
| Task distributor | Running predefined tasks asynchronously at scale | <https://github.com/Inveracity/nats-python-example> | | Python, RethinkDB, NATS |

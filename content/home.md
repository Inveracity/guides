## About
This is a collection of guides with minimal explanation that I use as reference for my own benefit.


The reason for the "_minimally explained_" bit is to keep it brief and fast to glance through.

> See the [docs section](/categories/) for a list of contents.

Feel free to open an issue on GitHub if you find anything to be wrong or out-of-date.

### About me

I'm Christopher.

I'm a **Software Engineer** with over a decade of experience. I primarily focus on DevEx and system integrations. This means writing a lot of CLI tools for CI pipelines, frontend programs for self-service portals.

I like to tinker with both backend and frontend technologies and have written my own chat

- <https://chat.christopherbaklid.com>

A task distributor

- <https://github.com/Inveracity/nats-python-example>

A desktop application to increase the volume on videos

And much more.

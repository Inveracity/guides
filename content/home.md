## README

This is a collection of guides with minimal explanation that I use as reference for my own benefit.
The reason for the "_minimally explained_" bit is to keep it brief and fast to glance through. See the [docs section](/categories/) for a list of contents.
Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Inveracity/guides) if you find anything to be incorrect or out of date.

### About myself

I'm Christopher.

I'm a **Software Engineer** with over a decade of experience. I primarily focus on DevEx and system integrations.
This means writing a lot of CLI tools, self-service UIs and infrastructure-as-code.
